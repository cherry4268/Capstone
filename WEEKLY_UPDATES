## WEEKLY UPDATE 2
This week I collected more data and began to normalize the datasets. The new datasets are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI data. 
In terms of normalization, I'm experimenting with STL Decomposition which will give me a breakdown of seasonal, trend, and remainder (residual) outliers. 
I'm also utilizing X-13ARIMA-SEATS, which is a package used by the US Census Bureau specifically for seasonal adjustment including holidays, weather phenomena, etc. 
The normalization I'm doing in R-studio since the package for X-13ARIMA-SEATS is included with R-studio and is difficult to install otherwise. 
I plan to replace the data currently sitting in my github repo with the seasonally adjusted data once I'm done. 
Some datasets from the grocery folder such as as "cereal_bakery" or "fish_seafood" need to be removed but all datasets I'm currently planning on using are up-to-date in the READ.me
