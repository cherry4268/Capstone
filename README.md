# Capstone - Cost of Living Predictor (U.S.)
DATS 4001 Capstone - Cherry Kuruppacherry

## Overview
This project develops a predictive model for individual cost of living by analyzing key expense categories including housing, transportation, grocery, and a few insurance costs. The analysis uses multi-variable techniques to understand how different factors contribute to living expenses across different regions in the United States.

## Project Objectives
- Develop predictive models for cost of living expenses - based on years 2015-2022
- Analyze regional and geographic trends in living costs
- Create Benchmarks for location-based decision-making
- Heatmap interactive display

## Data Sources
### Housing
- Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI); measures typical home values and market changes, covers 35th-65th percentile range, seasonally adjusted, measured by state
- others TBD

### Transportation
- National Association of Insurance Commissioners; "Auto Insurance Database Report" both for 2017/2018 and 2022 to cover years 2015-2022, measures combined average premium

   - https://content.naic.org/article/naic-releases-latest-auto-insurance-database-average-premium-supplement

### Grocery
- Map the Meal; includes average cost of a meal per state,  Weighted weekly $ needed by FI, and  Weighted Annual Food Budget Shortfall
