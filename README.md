The analysis uses multi-variable techniques to understand how different factors contribute to living expenses across different regions in the United States.

## Project Objectives
- Develop predictive models for cost of living expenses
- Analyze regional and geographic trends in living costs
- Create Benchmarks for location-based decision-making
- Heatmap interactive display
