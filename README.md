# Capstone - Cost of Living Predictor (U.S.)
DATS 4001 Capstone - Cherry Kuruppacherry

## Overview
This project develops a predictive model for individual cost of living by analyzing key expense categories including housing, transportation, grocery, and a few insurance costs. The analysis uses multi-variable techniques to understand how different factors contribute to living expenses across different regions in the United States.

## Project Objectives
- Develop predictive models for cost of living expenses
- Analyze regional and geographic trends in living costs
- Create Benchmarks for location-based decision-making
- Heatmap interactive display

## Data Sources
### Housing
- Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI); measures typical home values and market changes, covers 35th-65th percentile range, seasonally adjusted, measured by state
- others TBD

### Transportation
- Bureau of Labor Statistics Gasoline All-types, measured by region (West, Midwest, South, Northeast) and Size class (A, B, C), seasonally unadjusted
- others TBD

### Grocery
- TBD

### Insurance
- TBD
